# ao3-find-similar

This is a python script that will take an ao3 url as an import and output a selection of tags for you to search in the ao3 search bar to get a similar set of fics to the one you linked the url to. 

This script can be run locally (if you already know how to run python scripts you know this) or use an online python compiler. 

The following compiler works for me for the packages needed to run the script: https://repl.it/languages/python3  

To use the compiler just copy and past the .py document into the code section of the website, fill out the variables for what you want and press run!

Then watch the outputs to check everything worked and for your new tags that you can search by.
